## To Be Released

## 1.1.1 - 2016-06-05

### Fixed

- Close mention suggestions when suggestions filtered results are empty [#291](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/pull/291) [#265](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/265)

## 1.1.0 - 2016-05-27

### Added

- `MentionSuggestions` now accepts `onOpen`and `onClose` props. These callbacks are triggered when the popover has opened or closed.

## 1.0.2 - 2016-05-24

### Fixed

- Fix rendering the MentionSuggestions in IE11 by avoiding to render an Immutable List [#266](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/266) [#270](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/pull/270)
- Fix React 0.14.x support by returning `<noscript />` instead of `null` [#267](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/pull/267)

## 1.0.1 - 2016-04-29

### Fixed

- Make sure there is no autocomplete on tab after deleting a mention [#234](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/234)

## 1.0.0 - 2016-04-20

### Changed

- Instead of the popover inline it is now exported as `MentionSuggestions` and can be placed anywhere in the DOM. It's recommended to place it right after the Editor. This change was important to avoid selection issues trigged by `contentEditable={false}`.
- `mentions` has been renamed to `suggestions` and now has to be directly provided to the `MentionSuggestions` component as property.
- Moved to a flat configuration. Instead of plugin properties (decorators & hooks) being stored within pluginProps they now moved to the root object. See the changes here [#150](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/pull/150/files) as well as the initial discussion here [#143](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/143)
- Improved the regex and now test for a whitespace in front of the `@` to make sure it doesn't match on normal text like an email [#104](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/104)
- Moved the option `theme` from an Immutable Map to a JavaScript object. This is more likely to become a standard.
- Improved styling and added animations for the Suggestions overlay as well as the hover on a single suggestion.
- Updated the theme properties.

### Fixed

- Fix using backspace to close the autocomplete suggestions after typing an `@` [#110](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/110)

### Added

- The config now takes a property `entityMutability`. A developer can choose between 'IMMUTABLE', 'SEGMENTED' & 'MUTABLE'. Read in detail about it [here](https://facebook.github.io/draft-js/docs/advanced-topics-entities.html#mutability).
- The config now takes a property `positionSuggestions`. The function can be used to manipulate the position of the popover containing the suggestions. It receives one object as arguments containing the visible rectangle surrounding the decorated search string including the @. In addition the object contains prevProps, prevState, state & props. An object should be returned which can contain all sorts of styles. The defined properties will be applied as inline-styles.
- Introduce a new config property: `mentionPrefix`. By default it is an empty String. For Twitter or Slack like mention behaviour you can provide an `@`.

```
const mentionPlugin = createMentionPlugin({ entityMutability: 'IMMUTABLE' });
```

- The `MentionSuggestions` component now takes a property `onSearchChange` which will trigger whenever the search value of changes.
- The module now exports `defaultSuggestionsFilter` for convenience. As first argument it takes the search term as a String. The second argument is the Immutable list of mentions. The function returns the filter list based on substring matches.

## 0.0.4 - 2016-03-29

### Fixed
- Fix issue with showing two menus at the same time [#132](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/issues/132)
- When typing ahead to 0 results and then back the first item must be still selected. [#149](https://github.com/draft-js-plugins/draft-js-plugins/pull/149)

## 0.0.3 - 2016-03-25
### Released the first working version of DraftJS Mention Plugin

It's not recommended to use the version 0.0.0 - 0.0.2

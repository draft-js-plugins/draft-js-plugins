## To Be Released

### Added

- `onChange` & and all handlers now also receive: `getPlugins`, `getProps`, `getReadOnly`, `setReadOnly`, `getEditorRef`.
- `defaultBlockRenderMap` option, by default is set to true. If set to false the defaultBlockRenderMap from Draft.js is not used as base for the generated blockRenderMap.
- `decorators` option now allows custom implementations the [DraftDecoratorType](https://github.com/facebook/draft-js/blob/master/src/model/decorators/DraftDecoratorType.js) interface to be passed into the array along with the traditional CompositeDecorator objects
- added the utility function `composeDecorators` as a named export.

## 1.0.0 - 2016-04-20

### Changed

- Moved the option `theme` from an Immutable Map to a JavaScript object. This is more likely to become a standard.
- Instead of passing in the `editorState` and the `onChange` function is not necessary anymore. This is now handled by the plugin itself via a shared reference passed to the components.
